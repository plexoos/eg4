# ESI Optical Testbed

## About

This repository is meant for testing a variety of the Geant4 functionality
related to optical processes, mainly Cherenkov photon generation and propagation.

## Building

It strongly recommended to use the "out of source" build pattern. For example,
in the folder **optical1** one first creates a folder named "build", then
runs CMake and finally the build itself using _make_, from the build folder itself.
This can look as follows:

```bash
cd optical1
mkdir build
cmake -B build
cd build/
make
# you can use the -j option to make it work quicked, e.g.
make -j8
```
